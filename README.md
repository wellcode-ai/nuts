## üöÄ Installation

### From Releases

1. Download the appropriate binary for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts/releases)
2. Make it executable (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x nuts
   ```
3. Move it to your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   sudo mv nuts /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Windows
   # Move nuts.exe to a location in your PATH
   ```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts
cd nuts
cargo install --path .

# Or install directly from git
cargo install --git https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts
```

## ‚ö° 30-Second Start (Try It Now!)

```bash
# Install (choose one)
cargo install --git https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts
# OR download from releases: https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts/releases

# Start the interactive shell
nuts

# Try these commands immediately (no setup needed!)
> call GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
> call POST https://httpbin.org/post '{"name": "Test"}'
> perf GET https://httpbin.org/get --users 10

# AI features (optional - requires API key)
> config api-key  # Enter your Anthropic API key
> ask "Create a user with realistic data"
> monitor https://httpbin.org/get --smart
```

**That's it!** You're now using the most powerful API testing tool ever built. üöÄ

## ü§î What Makes NUTS Different?

**Instead of this (traditional tools):**
```bash
# Complex curl commands
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -d '{"name":"John","email":"john@example.com","role":"admin"}'

# Multiple tools needed
curl + jq + ab + custom scripts...
```

**You get this (NUTS):**
```bash
# Simple, powerful commands
> call POST https://api.example.com/users '{"name":"John"}'
> ask "Create a realistic user for testing"
> perf GET https://api.example.com/users --users 100
> monitor https://api.example.com --smart
```

**Why developers love NUTS:**
- üöÄ **Zero learning curve** - If you know curl, you know NUTS
- ü§ñ **AI-powered** - Natural language commands, smart monitoring, auto-fix
- ‚ö° **All-in-one** - Testing, monitoring, security, performance in one tool
- üéØ **Production-ready** - Built with Rust for reliability and speed

## üéØ Detailed Quick Start

### 1. Basic API Testing (Works Immediately)
```bash
# Simple GET request
> call GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

# POST with data
> call POST https://httpbin.org/post '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}'

# With headers and auth
> call -H "Content-Type: application/json" --bearer "token123" GET https://api.example.com/users
```

### 2. Performance Testing (No Setup Required)
```bash
# Basic load test
> perf GET https://httpbin.org/get

# Advanced load test
> perf GET https://api.example.com/users --users 100 --duration 30s
```

### 3. Configure AI Features (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
> config api-key
# Enter your Anthropic API key for AI features
```

### 4. Natural Language Commands (AI Required)
```bash
# Let AI create the perfect request for you
> ask "Create a POST request to register a new user with realistic data"
> ask "Get all products from an e-commerce API"
> ask "Delete user with ID 123"
```

### 5. Security Scanning (AI Required)
```bash
# Basic security scan
> security https://api.example.com

# Deep security analysis
> security https://api.example.com --deep --save security_report.json
```

### 6. Health Monitoring
```bash
# Basic monitoring
> monitor https://api.example.com

# Smart monitoring with AI insights
> monitor https://api.example.com --smart
```
