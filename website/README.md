### ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface** - Just describe what you want: `ask "create a user with realistic data"`
- **Smart API Testing** - Advanced HTTP client with CURL-like features
- **AI-Powered Security Scanning** - Intelligent vulnerability detection
- **Real-time Health Monitoring** - Smart monitoring with predictive insights
- **Performance Testing** - Concurrent load testing with AI analysis
- **OpenAPI Flow Management** - Create, manage, and execute API collections
- **Mock Server Generation** - Generate mock servers from OpenAPI specs
- **Interactive Shell** - Tab completion and command history

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

#### 1. Installation
```bash
# From releases
curl -L https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts/releases/latest/download/nuts-linux-amd64 -o nuts
chmod +x nuts
sudo mv nuts /usr/local/bin/

# From source
cargo install --git https://github.com/wellcode-ai/nuts
```

#### 2. Basic Usage
```bash
# Start the interactive shell
nuts

# Basic API testing
> call GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

# Natural language commands (AI required)
> ask "Create a POST request to register a new user with realistic data"

# Performance testing
> perf GET https://api.example.com/users --users 100 --duration 30s

# Security scanning
> security https://api.example.com --deep

# Health monitoring
> monitor https://api.example.com --smart
```

## Website Development

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
